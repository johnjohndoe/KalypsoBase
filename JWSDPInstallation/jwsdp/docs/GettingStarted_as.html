<H3>Introduction</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You can use this page to quickly deploy your own Web applications, start 
  the Sun Java System Application Server, try out tools that come with the 
  Java WSDP, and see where to get the documentation that more completely 
  explains how to use the technologies in the Java WSDP. The instructions on 
  this page assume that you have already performed a "Typical" installation 
  (installed all of the components). 
</P>

<H3>Deploying Your Own Web Applications</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>To quickly deploy your own Web applications, copy your Web archive (WAR) 
  files to the <CODE>&lt;<i>AS_HOME</i>&gt;/domains/domain1/autodeploy</CODE> 
  directory. When you start the Application Server, these applications will 
  be deployed. See the "Getting Started with Web Applications" chapter of the 
  <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/docs/tutorial/doc/index.html">J2EE 
  Tutorial</a> for more information about deploying Web applications. 
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Starting the Application Server</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>On a system running the Solaris or Linux operating system, go to the 
  <CODE>&lt;<i>AS_HOME</i>&gt;/bin</CODE> directory and execute the following command
  to bring up the Application Server: 
</P>
<pre>
asadmin start-domain domain1
</pre>

<P>On a system running Microsoft Windows, from the Start menu, select Programs, 
   Sun Microsystems, J2EE 1.4 SDK, and Start Default Server. Once the server 
   is up and running, point your browser to 
   <CODE>http://localhost:8080/JWSDP.html</CODE>. The page that is 
   displayed contains links to several sample programs. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Administration Tools</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>The Application Server comes with a set of tools for managing the server and 
for packaging, deploying, and running J2EE applications. Many of these tools are 
listed in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>. Most of the commands that invoke these 
tools are in the <code>&lt;<i>AS_HOME</i>&gt;/bin</code> 
directory. For more information, see the files 
<code>&lt;<i>AS_HOME</i>&gt;/docs/about.html</code> and 
<code>&lt;<i>AS_HOME</i>&gt;/docs/QuickStart.html</code>, the 
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/docs/tutorial/doc/index.html">J2EE 
Tutorial</a>, and the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/817-6088">Sun Java 
System Application Server Platform Edition 8 Administration Guide</a>.</p>

<table BORDER CELLPADDING="5" summary="Application Server Tool Commands">
<caption><a NAME="table2"></a><i>Table 1. Application Server Tool 
Commands</i></caption>

<tr>
<th>Command</th>

<th>Description</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>asadmin</code></td>
<td>Runs the application server administration utility, used to start and stop 
the Application Server and manage users, resources, and applications. 
<p>Type <code>asadmin help</code> to get a list of the many <code>asadmin</code> 
subcommands.</p>
<p>The <code>asadmin</code> command has a corresponding tool, the Admin Console, 
which allows you to perform administrative tasks using a Graphical User 
Interface. To use the Admin Console, open the URL 
<code>http://localhost:4848/asadmin/</code> in a browser after starting the 
server.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>asant</code></td>

<td>Runs a portable command line build tool that is an extension of the Ant tool 
developed by the Apache Software Foundation (see <a 
href="http://ant.apache.org/" target="blank">http://ant.apache.org/</a>). 
<code>asant</code> provides additional tasks that interact with the Application 
Server administration utility.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>deploytool</code></td>

<td>Runs the Application Server deployment tool, a standalone GUI tool to 
package applications, generate deployment descriptors, and deploy applications 
on the application server.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>startserver</code></td>

<td>Applications that use entity beans normally access the PointBase 
database management server, which is included in the Application Server. To 
start PointBase on a Solaris or Linux system, use the 
<code>pointbase/tools/serveroption/startserver.sh</code> command. On a Windows 
system, the command is <code>startserver.bat</code>. To stop PointBase, enter 
<code>q</code> or <code>x</code> in the window in which PointBase is running.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>appclient</code></td>

<td>Runs a J2EE application client by launching the application client container 
and invoking the client application packaged in the application client JAR 
file.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>wscompile</code></td>

<td>Generates stubs, ties, serializers, and WSDL files used in JAX-RPC clients 
and services. </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>wsdeploy</code></td>

<td>Generates implementation-specific, ready-to-deploy WAR files for Web service 
applications that use JAX-RPC.</td>
</tr>
