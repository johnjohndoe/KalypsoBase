<H1>Getting Started with Java<SUP><FONT size=-2>TM</FONT></SUP> Web Services 
Developer Pack 1.4 on the Tomcat 5.0 for Java WSDP Container</H1>
<blockquote>
<P>You can use this page to quickly deploy your own Web applications, start 
   the Tomcat 5 server, try out Tomcat administration tools and tools that 
   come with the Java WSDP, and see where to get the documentation that more 
   completely explains how to use the technologies in the Java WSDP. The 
   instructions on this page assume that you have already performed a "Typical" 
   installation (installed all of the components). 
</P>

<H3>Deploying Your Own Web Applications</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>To quickly deploy your own Web applications, copy your Web archive (WAR) 
   files to the <CODE>&lt;TOMCAT_HOME&gt;/webapps</CODE> 
   directory. When you start the Tomcat server, these applications will 
   be deployed. See <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-5.0-doc/deployer-howto.html">"Deployer HOW-TO"</a> 
   for more information about deploying Web applications in the Tomcat 5.0 for 
   Java WSDP Container.
</p>
</blockquote>

<H3>Starting the Java WSDP</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>On a system running the Solaris or Linux operating system, go to the 
  <CODE>&lt;JWSDP_HOME&gt;/bin</CODE> directory and execute the 
  <CODE>startup.sh</CODE> script to bring up the Java WSDP. On a system running 
  Microsoft Windows, from the Start menu, select Programs, Java(tm) Web Services 
  Developer Pack 1.4, and Start Tomcat. Once the server is up and running, point 
  your browser to <CODE>http://localhost:8080</CODE>, the default port at which 
  the process is running. The page that is displayed contains links to several 
  sample programs and administration tools. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Administration Tools</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Tomcat 5.0 for Java WSDP Container includes administration tools, such as the Tomcat 
  Web Application Manager and the Tomcat Web Server Administration Tool. For 
  each of these tools, you will need to log in using the user name and password 
  combination defined when you installed the Java WSDP. The Tomcat server must 
  be up and running to use these tools. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>Tomcat Web Application Manager</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Point to the following URL in your browser:</P>
  <P><CODE>http://localhost:8080/manager/html</CODE></P>
  <P>Tomcat's Web-based management tool will be displayed. You can use this to 
  list, install, reload, and remove Web applications as well as manage your 
  Tomcat server. See <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-5.0-doc/manager-howto.html">"Manager App HOW-TO"</a> 
  for information about using this tool. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>Tomcat Web Server Administration Tool</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Point to the following URL in your browser to start up the Tomcat Web 
  Server Administration Tool: </P>
  <P><CODE>http://localhost:8080/admin</CODE> </P>
  <P>The Tomcat Web Server Administration Tool, also called the 
  <CODE>admintool</CODE> utility, is used to configure the behavior of the 
  Tomcat Web server container while it is running. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Accessing the Java WSDP Documentation</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>See the index page at 
  <CODE>&lt;<EM>JWSDP_HOME</EM>&gt;/docs/index.html</CODE> for links to the Java 
  WSDP documentation. That page contains links to the API documentation for all 
  of the technologies, release notes, and comprehensive reference documentation 
  for all the technologies. </P>
