<font color="#000099">
Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> API for XML Registries (JAXR)<br>
Sample Applications</font></h1>

<b>Specification Version:</b> 1.0<br>
<b>Reference Implementation (RI) Version:</b> 1.0.6
</center>

<h3>jaxr-publish</h3>
<p>This example, in the directory 
<tt>&lt;<i>JWSDP_HOME</i>&gt;/jaxr/samples/jaxr-publish</tt>, 
shows how to use the JAXR APIs to publish information about an organization 
to a registry, including information about services provided
by the organization and contact information.</p>
<p>The example also illustrates how to classify registry entries using
well-known classification schemes like the North American Industry Classification
System (NAICS) and standard identifiers like the Dun &amp; Bradstreet DUNS
identifier.</p>

<h4>Configuration</h4>
Before running the example, configure it as follows:
<ol>
<li>
By default, the registry publishes information to the Java WSDP 
Registry Server, the private UDDI V2 registry implementation bundled with the 
Java WSDP.

<p>You can publish to any registry you wish by setting the following
properties in the <code>publish.properties</code> file:
<blockquote>
<code>query.url</code>: the URL for sending queries to the registry
<br><code>publish.url</code>: the URL for publishing data to the registry
</blockquote>
<b>Note:</b> The URLs for the public registries can be found here: 
<tt><a href="http://www.uddi.org/find.html">http://www.uddi.org/find.html</a></tt>
<p>To publish data to any of the public registries, you need to register
first with the registry provider.
</li>
<li>
If you are running the example from behind a firewall and are using a public 
registry, add the proxy information by setting the following properties:
<blockquote>
<tt>http.proxy.host<br>
http.proxy.port</tt>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
By default, the <tt>user.name</tt> and <tt>user.password</tt> properties are 
set to the values used by the Java WSDP Registry Server. If you are using a 
public registry, provide the username and password you obtained when you 
registered with the registry provider.
</li>
</ol>

<h4>Running the Sample</h4>
<p>On Windows systems, at the prompt, type <tt>.\BLCM</tt>.</p>
<p>On UNIX systems, at the prompt, type <tt>./BLCM.sh</tt>.</p>

<h4>Results</h4>
<p>You should see the following message for a successful run:</p>
<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Organization Saved
</pre>
<p>You may ignore the warning messages about PostalAddressMappings.</p>

<h3>jaxr-query</h3>
<p>This example, in the directory 
<tt>&lt;<i>JWSDP_HOME</i>&gt;/jaxr/samples/jaxr-query</tt>, shows how to use 
the JAXR APIs to query a registry for data -- specifically, how to query for an 
organization by name. The example also illustrates how to parse the retrieved 
information for details about the organization and the services it provides.</p>

<h4>Configuration</h4>
<p>Before running the example, configure it as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
By default, the registry queries for information from the Java WSDP Registry 
Server. You can query any registry you wish by setting the following 
properties in the <tt>query.properties</tt> file:

<blockquote><tt>query.url</tt>: the URL for sending queries to the
registry
<br><tt>publish.url</tt>: the URL for publishing data to the registry</blockquote>
<p>The URLs for the public registries can be found here: 
<tt><a href="">http://www.uddi.org/find.html</a></tt>.</p>
</li>
<li>
If you are running the example from behind a firewall and are querying a public 
registry, add the proxy information by setting the following properties:

<blockquote><tt>http.proxy.host<br>
http.proxy.port</tt></blockquote>
</li>

<li>
You can edit the pattern being searched for by editing the settings for
the <code>company</code> variable in the source code. By default, the sample
uses the search string <code>%USA%</code>, which returns any name containing 
"usa" or "USA", including the organization published in the 
<tt>jaxr-publish</tt> sample.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Running the Sample</h4>
<p>On Windows systems, at the prompt, type <tt>.\BQM</tt>.</p>
<p>On UNIX systems, at the prompt, type <tt>./BQM.sh </tt>.</p>

<h4>Results</h4>
<p>You should see the following message for a successful run, followed by 
information about the registry entries retrieved:</p>
<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Successfully queried the registry for organizations matching ....
</pre>

<h3>jaxr-browser</h3>
<p>This is a more sophisticated example showing how to use the JAXR APIs to
provide a common interface to heterogenous registries. The registry interactions
using the JAXR APIs are all illustrated in the <tt>JAXRClient</tt> source
code. The example is in the directory 
<tt>&lt;<i>JWSDP_HOME</i>&gt;/jaxr/samples/jaxr-browser</tt>.</p>

<h4>Configuration</h4>
<p>If you will run the browser from behind a firewall, make sure that you have 
set the <tt>http.proxyPort</tt> and <tt>http.proxyHost</tt> properties in the 
file <tt>&lt;<i>JWSDP_HOME</i>&gt;/conf/jwsdp.properties</tt>.</p>

<h4>Running the Sample</h4>
<p>The scripts for starting the browser are located under 
<tt>&lt;<i>JWSDP_HOME</i>>/jaxr/bin</tt>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
Use the following commands to start the browser:</li>

<blockquote>On Windows systems: <tt>.\jaxr-browser</tt>
<br>On UNIX systems: <tt>./jaxr-browser.sh</tt></blockquote>

<li>
To override the values set in 
<tt>&lt;<i>JWSDP_HOME</i>&gt;/conf/jwsdp.properties</tt>, add the following
arguments to specify proxy information:

<pre>
./jaxr-browser.sh <i>http-proxy-host http-proxy-port https-proxy-host https-proxy-port</i>
</pre>

<p>The entire command should be typed on one line.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h4>Using the JAXR Browser</h4>

<ol>
<li>
Select a Registry Location URL. Use inquiry URLs for querying the registry.
Use publishing URLs for publishing to the registry.

<p>Several of the commonly used URLs are preconfigured in the list,
but you can also specify your own here.</li>
<p>
<li>To query the registry, select the Browse panel, add the information,
and click Search.
<p>To publish information to the registry, select the Submissions Panel.
Make sure you have the publishing URL selected for the Registry Location.
Fill in the information to publish and click Submit. It brings up
an authentication dialog. Type in the username and password for your account
on the registry and click OK to publish the entry to the registry.</p>
</li>
