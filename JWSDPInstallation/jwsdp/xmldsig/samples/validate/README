This is a simple example of validating an XML Signature using the
JSR 105 API. The example assumes the validating key is contained
in a KeyValue KeyInfo element in the XML Signature.

Command Line Usage:

  Modify the build.properties file if you are behind a firewall and use
  an HTTP proxy server.

  $ ant

  This will validate the signature in the file envelopedSignature.xml in 
  the current working directory. 

  To validate a different signature, run as follows:

  $ ant -Dsample.args="signature.xml" 

    where "signature.xml" is the pathname of the file.
