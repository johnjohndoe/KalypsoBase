<h2>Read This Section First</h2>
</a>
<p>Before you work with this release, make sure that
you have installed the required software
and are on a supported operating system.
You can find this information in the
<a href="../../docs/index.html">Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup>
Web Services Developer Pack (Java WSDP) home page</a> and <a
 href="../../docs/ReleaseNotes.html">Release Notes</a>.
</p>
<a name="what">
<h2>What This Release Includes</h2>
</a>
<p>This release includes the following XML and Web Services Security
(XWS-Security)
features:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Support for securing JAX-RPC applications and applications that
use SAAJ.
  </li>
  <li>A sample security framework within which a JAX-RPC
or SAAJ application developer will be able to secure
applications by signing/verifying parts of SOAP messages and/or
encrypting/decrypting parts of a SOAP message. The message sender can 
make claims about the security properties by associating security
tokens with the message. An example of a security claim is the
identity of the sender, identified using username and password.
  </li>
  <li>Web Services Security (WSS) interop scenarios. Developers will 
be able to send and receive messages compliant with the WSS Soap 
Message Security specification. Developers can use the framework to 
implement applications which have security requirements similar to 
those defined in the WSS interop scenarios. More information on the 
scenarios can be found at <a
 href="http://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/wss/200306/msg00002.html">
Draft Spec for Interop1 (draft 5)</a> and <a
 href="http://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/wss/200310/msg00003.html">
Final Spec for Interop2 (draft 6)</a>. </li>
<!-- <li>A  SAAJ sample  named <code>soapprocessor</code> that  has SOAP 
        processing capabilities as defined in the SOAP 1.1 specification. Developers who are using plain SAAJ (and not JAX-RPC) can make use of this sample and its interfaces in conjunction with XWS-Security to secure their SOAP messages. 
        See the <a href="./index.html">XML and Web 
        Services Security</a> home page -->
  <li>Command-line tools that provide specialized utilities for
  keystore management: <code>pkcs12import</code>
  and <code>keyexport</code>.  Also, the addition of the <code>-security</code>
  option for the <code>wscompile</code> utility to allow specification of a
  security configuration for a JAX-RPC application.
  </li>
  <li>Sample programs
  </li>
</ul>

<a name="limitations">
<h2>Current Limitations</h2>
</a>
<p>This release of XWS-Security includes the following limitations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Since the Java Standards for key Web Services Security
technologies are still being defined under the Java Community Process,
the current APIs in this release are <i>nonstandard</i> and are
subject to change in future releases. </li>
  <li>Examples written using an earlier release of XWS-Security APIs
will not run on this release of the JWSDP.</li>
  <li>XWS-Security cannot be used for securing message attachments.</li>
  <li>JAX-RPC dynamic proxies are not yet supported, only static stubs
work.</li>
   <li>Support allowing the message recipient to enforce security 
   requirements on the messages it receives is not supported.</li>
</ul>
<a name="bugs">
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
</a>
<p>In this release, the XWS-Security implementation has the following
known
issues:
</p>
<ul>
  
  <li>Certificate validation does not check for certificate revocation.
The security environment cannot set up a Certificate Revocation List
(CRL) corresponding to a certificate authority. <!--Learn more about this
