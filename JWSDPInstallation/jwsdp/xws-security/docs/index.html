<h1>
XML and Web Services Security</h1>
<center>
<p><br>
<b>Implementation Version: </b>EA3</p>
</center>
<p> This XML and Web Services Security Early Access implementation,
included as part of the Java<font size="-2"><sup>TM</sup></font> Web
Services Developer Pack 1.4, provides a framework within which a
JAX-RPC application developer will be able to secure applications.  
This implementation is based on the oasis WSS specification, which can
be viewed at <a href=
"http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-soap-message-security-1.0.pdf">
http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-soap-message-security-1.0.pdf</a>.</p>

<p>Applications can be secured in
the following ways: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Sign and/or verify parts of the SOAP messages.
    <p>This implementation of XML and Web Services Security uses
Apache's XML-DSig (XML Digital Signature) implementation, which is
based on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Signature/"> XML-Signature
Syntax and Processing</a> W3C standard. </p>

<p><a href="samples.html">Samples</a> containing
code for signing and/or verifying parts of the SOAP message are
included with this release.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Encrypt and/or decrypt part of the SOAP message.
    <p>This implementation of XML and Web Services Security uses
Apache's XML-Enc (XML Encryption) implementation, which is based on the
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlenc-core/"> XML Encryption</a> W3C
standard. </p>
<p><a href="samples.html">Samples</a> containing
code for encrypting and/or decrypting parts of the SOAP message are
included with this release.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Send UserName tokens and  X509 certificate tokens along with
the message.</p>

<p>Sending these tokens with a message binds the identity of the 
tokens (and any other claims occurring in the security token) to the message.</p>

 
    <p>This implementation of XML and Web Services Security provides
support for Username Token Profile, which is based on <a
 href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-username-token-profile-1.0.pdf">OASIS
WSS Username Token Profile 1.0</a>,  and X509 Certificate Token
Profile, which is based on  <a
 href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-x509-token-profile-1.0.pdf">OASIS
WSS X509 Certificate Token Profile 1.0</a>. </p>

<p><a href="samples.html">Samples</a> containing
code for sending user name and X509 certificate tokens along with 
the SOAP message are
included with this release.</p> </li>
    </p>
 
  <li>
  Implement Interoperable Web Services Security applications.
  </li>
 
    <p>This implementation of XML and Web Services Security fully
supports the  implementation of Web Services Security (WSS) Interop scenarios. The
following are some of the interoperability scenarios documents that are
supported by this implementation:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a
 href="http://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/wss/200306/msg00002.html">
Draft Spec for Interop1 (draft 5)</a></li>
      <li><a
 href="http://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/wss/200310/msg00003.html">
Final Spec for Interop2 (draft 6)</a></li>
    </ul>
<p> A <a href="samples.html">sample</a> containing
implementations of all the WSS Interop Scenarios is included in this
release.</p>
  </li>
</ul>



<p>Since the Java standards for some of these security technologies are
undergoing definition under the <a
 href="http://www.jcp.org/en/home/index">Java Community Process</a>,
the security solution that is provided in the Java Web Services
Developer Pack 1.4 is based on <i>nonstandard</i> APIs, which are
subject to change with new revisions of the technology. As standards
are defined in the Web Services Security space, we will be moving
toward using the appropriate standard APIs instead of these nonstandard
APIs. </p>
<p> This distribution includes samples that show how a JAX-RPC
application developer can use the XML and Web Services Security
technology. <!-- The nonstandard APIs that can be used by the JAX-RPC
application developer are documented in <a href="./api/index.html">API
documentation</a>.--> As previously noted, these <i>nonstandard</i> APIs
are subject to change and will be replaced with appropriate
standards-based APIs as those APIs are defined. <a name="jsr"></a>

<h2>How XWS-Security and JSRs 105 and 106 are related</h2>
<p>XWS-Security APIs are used for securing Web services based
on JAX-RPC or SAAJ. This release of XWS-Security is based on
non-standard XML Digital Signature and XML Encryption APIs.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=105">JSR-105</a> (XML
Digital Signature APIs) are included in this release of the JWSDP as
well. JSR 105 is a standard API (in progress, almost at Proposed Final
Draft)
for generating and validating XML Signatures as specified by the W3C
recommendation. It is an API that should be used by Java applications
and
middleware that need to create and/or process XML Signatures. It can be
used by Web Services Security (which is the goal for a future release)
and
by non-Web Services technologies, for example, documents
stored or transferred in XML. Both JSR 105 and <a
 href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=106">JSR 106</a> (XML
Digital Encryption APIs)
are core-XML security components. </p>
<p>XWS-Security does not use the JSR 105 or JSR 106 APIs. XWS-Security
uses the Apache libraries for DSig and XML-Enc. In future releases,
the goal of XWS-Security is to move toward using JSR 105 and JSR 106
APIs.</p>

<h2>Command-line tools</h2>
<p>In this release, the following command-line tools that provide specialized
utilities for keystore management are included:
   <ul>
        <li><code>pkcs12import</code>
        <p>This tool helps with importing the contents (key/certificate pair)
        of a PKCS-12 file into a keystore.</p></li>
        <li><code>keyexport</code>
        <p>This tool can be used to export the private key corresponding
        to a specified entry of a keystore into a file.</p></li>
   </ul>
<p>In this release, you can use the <code>wscompile</code> utility with the <code>-security</code>
option to specify a security configuration to use for an application.
