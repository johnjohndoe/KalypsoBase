Five versions of the OWS Common set of XML Schema Documents are now 
attached to this page.

The 0.3.0 version are the XML Schema Documents attached to OGC document
04-016r2, approved as a Recommendation Paper in the April 2004 OGC
meetings.

The 0.3.1 version are the XML Schema Documents attached to OGC document
04-016r3, containing that editing of document 04-016r2. This
Recommendation Paper is available to the public at
http://portal.opengis.org/files/?artifact_id=6324.

The 0.3.2 version are the XML Schema Documents after correcting one small
incorrect difference from OGC document 04-016r3.

The 0.4.0 version are the XML Schema Documents for OGC document 04-016r5.

The 1.0.0 version are the XML Schema Documents for OGC document 05-008, 
approved as an Implementation Specification in May 2005.

All five of these sets of XML Schema Documents have been edited to 
reflect the corrigenda to all those OGC documents which are based on the 
change requests: 
OGC 05-068r1 "Store xlinks.xsd file at a fixed location”
OGC 05-081r2 "Change to use relative paths”
