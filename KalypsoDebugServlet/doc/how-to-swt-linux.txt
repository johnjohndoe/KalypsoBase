In order to use the swt classes from a servlet under linux, you have to manually set the windowing system in the web.xml file.
It is simple: just add '-ws gtk' to the command line.

<init-param>
			<param-name>commandline</param-name>
			<param-value>-console -ws gtk</param-value>			
</init-param>

This is necessary, because (for what reason i dont know) 'motif' is assumed as standard windows system, which leads to an error when the platform tries to load the swt-gtk fragment.
