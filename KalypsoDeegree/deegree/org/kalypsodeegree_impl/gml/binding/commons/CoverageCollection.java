 * Files in this package are originally taken from deegree and modified here
 * to fit in kalypso. As goals of kalypso differ from that one in deegree
 * interface-compatibility to deegree is wanted but not retained always.
 *
 * If you intend to use this software in other ways than in kalypso
 * (e.g. OGC-web services), you should consider the latest version of deegree,
