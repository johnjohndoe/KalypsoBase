The file deegree-crs-configuration.xml is used by deegree2 to configure coordinate systems.
This one here is a mofified one with a coordinate system added (EPSG:3575) at the top of it.
The file in the deegree2_v2_2.jar was replaced with it.

The file epsg3575.gml contains the information from www.spatialreference.org, which was used to add the coordinate system.
Should there be a new deegree version, do not forget to add the coordinate system again, if it is still missing in the new version.
