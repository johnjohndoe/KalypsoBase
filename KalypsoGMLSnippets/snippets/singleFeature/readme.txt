This example shows how to declare a simple feature with only one additional property.

There are two versions of the schema:
- inlineType: the complexType of the element which defined the feature-type is declared inline
- namedType:  the complexType of the element which defined the feature-type is declared top-level, and is hence named

The result is in both cases identical.
