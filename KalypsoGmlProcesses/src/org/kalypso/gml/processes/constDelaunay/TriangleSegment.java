 * Spec:<BR>
 * segment#, startpoint, endpoint, [boundary marker]<BR>
 * Segments are edges whose presence in the triangulation is enforced (although each segment may be subdivided into
 * smaller edges). Each segment is specified by listing the indices of its two endpoints. This means that you must
 * include its endpoints in the vertex list. Each segment, like each vertex, may have a boundary marker.
