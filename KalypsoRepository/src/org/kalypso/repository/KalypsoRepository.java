 * to fit in kalypso. As goals of kalypso differ from that one in deegree
 * interface-compatibility to deegree is wanted but not retained always.
 * 
 * If you intend to use this software in other ways than in kalypso
 * (e.g. OGC-web services), you should consider the latest version of deegree,
 * see http://www.deegree.org .
